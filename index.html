        What are racist housing policies?
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p class = "desc">
        The housing shortage in 1933 led to the practice of implementing racist housing policies such as redlining or blockbusting. These policies were implemented by the government and banks because they were trying to build newer and predominantly white housing communities. The practice of redlining involves categorizing different communities and neighborhoods based on the amount of certain ethnic groups and races. Then the communities with the largest amount of people who were of a certain race would be redlined and labeled as not eligible for a loan on the basis of their race. And the communities with the most white residents would be presumed to be eligible for loans and a safe investment. These racist policies were typically targeted towards African Americans. By cutting of communities from financial aid and resources, these communities were separated from resources. While these practices occurred predominantly from 1930s to 1960s. Their effects still show today and still subtler racist policies are still being implemented.

"Corporate America don't bring jobs to our communities,<br> and they damn sure ain't quick to hire us. Then, shit, even if you have a high school diploma, so many<br>of the schools in our neighborhoods don't prepare us well enough.</p>

    <p class = "sum" style="float: right; margin-right: 1%;"><b style="font-size: 120%;">Analysis 1</b><br>The context of this quote is when Starr and her father talk about the lack of opportunities that black communities receive because of their isolation from resources. Also, this was after Starr was uneasy because they were stopped by a police officer.  This quote shows how the constant racism showed by banks and governments caused African American communities to be isolated and cut off from resources. This means that these communities are not able to get economic opportunities and/or jobs because of the lack of resources.

It's like they picked the worst parts-the<br> drug addicts roaming the streets, the broken down Cedar Grove projects, gangbangers flashing signs,<br> bodies on the sidewalks with white sheets over them.

    <p class = "sum" style="float: right; margin-right: 1%;"><b style="font-size: 120%;">Analysis 2</b><br>The context of this quote is when a news anchor describes the neighborhood that Starr resides in. This news was for the interview of One-Fifteen's dad. This connects to how banks and the US overall treats African Americans unfairly in terms of housing. This is because, due to the effects of blockbusting, redlining and other racist housing policies, some communities end up with mostly African Americans. And because banks and the government don't give them resources, a couple communities are referenced as the "ghetto" and that's where a lot of the housing projects are constructed, because of the large number of low income people who are not able to get jobs because of their race and neighborhood.

    <p class = "sum" style="float: right; margin-right: 1%;"><b style="font-size: 120%;">Analysis 3</b><br>The context of this quote is when Starr is describing for her first attempt at a sleepover at her home. One of her friend did not come because her father described their neighborhood as the "ghetto" and the other one left because of the guns fired at night. This quote shows how Starr's neighborhood is described as "the ghetto" by others. This shows how segregation is shown to African americans and minorities caused by the racist housing policies put into place by the banks and government.

Uncle Carlos is worried for Starr's safety in this neighborhood. This quote shows how this neighborhood is poisonous as Starr already saw two of her friends die in front of her. The danger of this neighborhood is apparent and even though Starr's family is able to afford moving, a lot of other families in Garden Heights cannot move due to lack of resources and money that is provided to them by the banks and the government.

    <p class = "sum"><b style="font-size: 120%;">Quote 5</b><br>"Exactly. drugs come from somewhere, and they're destroying our community," he says. You got<br>folks like Brenda, who think they need them to survive, and then you got the Khalils, who think they need<br>to sell them to survive. The Brendas can't get jobs unless they're clean, and they can't pay for rehab<br>unless they got jobs. When the Khalils get arrested for selling drugs, they either spend most of their life in prison, another billion-dollar industry, or they have a hard time getting a real job and probably start<br>selling drugs again. That's the hate they're giving us, baby, a system designed against us. That's Thug<br>Life."</p>

    <p class = "sum" style="float: right; margin-right: 1%;"><b style="font-size: 120%;">Analysis 5</b><br>This quote is stated by Maverick while he was explaining the injustice that the system and government shows African americans and minorities. He's talking to Starr about why certain things happen within their neighborhood. This quote shows how banks and the government designed a housing system against minorities. Because in this quote, Maverick states "a system designed against us", he refers to how it's so hard to escape their neighborhood because of the lack of resources offered to them by the system. And the system doesn't hire them because they come from this neighborhood and the system doesn't give them money or resources to help them recover. This quote shows the long lasting effects of blockbusting and redlining on the African american and minority community.
